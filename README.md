# Who is **electricvan213**

I am a nerdy 9th grader with various interests. When I say *various*, I mean that I am a ***Jack of all trades, Master of None***. **Coding** is one such trade sitting alongside **Video Production** and **Gaming**. The general commonality with all these interests is that **They are Computer Based**. In that regard, I am the ultimate *Jack* of the Computer.
