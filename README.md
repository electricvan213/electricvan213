# Who is **electricvan213**

I am a nerdy 9th grader with various interests. When I say *various*, I mean that I am a ***Jack of all trades, Master of None***. **Coding** is one such trade sitting alongside **Video Production** and **Gaming**. The general commonality with all these interests is that **They are Computer Based**. In that regard, I am the ultimate *Jack* of the Computer.

To add to that, I am an amateur, *or Jack*, in multiple programing languages:
- PHP
- HTML
- Python
- Lua
- JavaScript

Diversity is the general *rule of thumb* I follow.
